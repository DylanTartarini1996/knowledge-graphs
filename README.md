## What is a Knowledge Graph?
A Knowledge Graph is a structured representation of information that connects concepts, entities, and their relationships in a way that mimics human understanding. It is often used to organize and integrate data from various sources, enabling machines to reason, infer, and retrieve relevant information more effectively.

The key features of Knowledge Graphs can be divided in:

* Entities (Nodes): represent real-world objects like people, places, organizations, or abstract concepts;
* Relationships (Edges): define how entities are connected between them (i.e: “Bill → WORKS_AT → Microsoft”);
* Attributes (Properties): provide additional details about entities (e.g., Microsoft’s founding year, revenue, or location) or relationships ( i.e. “Bill → FRIENDS_WITH {since: 2021} → Mark”);
* Ontology (Schema): defines the structure and rules of the graph, ensuring consistency across the represented knowledge.
